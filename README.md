# MachineLearning
Project objective - use machine learning techniques to predict project budget based on existing project data points 
Repo contents:
1) ProjectBudgetPrediction - contains Python scripts to process & implement machince learning algos. Files are in Jupyter notebook format. Detailed steps have been documented within the code
2) Source data - obtained from a US Goverment website that contained data on public contruction projects. Data points provided were: Project Name, Phase	Planned Duration,	Actual Duration,	Project Budget,	Estimate of Actual Costs-End of Phase,	Total Phase Actual Spending
For machine learning, data was split as follows: 
  X - input variables - all the columns except for the last one
  Y - target variable - the last column - Total Phase Actual Spending
